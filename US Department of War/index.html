            <h1>Air Superiority Fighters</h1>
            <p>Air Superiority Fighters are purpose-built combat aircraft designed to achieve and maintain
                control
                of the skies by defeating enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat. Their primary mission is to
                dominate
                aerial battlespace, clear air corridors, and ensure friendly forces can operate without threat
                from
                hostile aircraft. These fighters prioritize maneuverability, advanced sensors, superior weapon
                systems, and high-performance propulsion to outperform opponents in both beyond-visual-range
                (BVR)
                and within-visual-range (WVR) engagements.</p>

                allowing them to switch between air-to-air and air-to-ground roles with minimal reconfiguration. Their
                design emphasizes flexibility, enabling a single platform to conduct interception, ground attack,
                reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and close air support depending on mission needs. This versatility
                makes them extremely valuable to modern air forces seeking cost efficiency and operational flexibility.

            <h1>Interceptors</h1>
            <p> Interceptors are high-speed fighter aircraft designed primarily to detect, engage, and destroy incoming
                enemy aircraft before they reach their targets. Their core mission is defensive: to quickly scramble,
                climb rapidly to high altitude, and neutralize threats such as strategic bombers, reconnaissance
                aircraft, or hostile fighters approaching national airspace.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Interceptors prioritize speed, climb rate, and long-range radar over multirole flexibility. Many are
                equipped with powerful engines, large radars, and long-range air-to-air missiles optimized for
                beyond-visual-range (BVR) combat. Because of their specialized mission, they typically carry lighter
                ground-attack capabilities or none at all.

            <p> Carrier-based fighters are combat aircraft engineered to operate from aircraft carriers, which requires
                unique structural and operational adaptations. These fighters feature reinforced landing gear, tailhooks
                for arrested landings, and folding wings to conserve deck and hangar space. Their design prioritizes
                versatility, ruggedness, and the ability to conduct missions far from traditional airbases.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Carrier-based fighters typically perform air superiority, fleet defense, strike missions, and
                reconnaissance, making them core assets of naval aviation. Their systems are optimized for maritime
                environments, including corrosion-resistant materials and advanced navigation for over-water operations.

            <p> Trainer fighters are specialized aircraft designed to prepare pilots for flying high-performance combat
                aircraft. They are used for advanced flight training, weapons practice, and tactical simulations before
                pilots transition to front-line fighters. These aircraft are typically slower, easier to handle, and
                more forgiving than operational fighters, while still incorporating many systems found in combat jets,
                such as ejection seats, avionics, and weapon simulation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Modern trainer fighters often serve a dual role as light attack or reconnaissance aircraft, allowing them
